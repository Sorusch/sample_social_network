== Welcome to the Sample Social Network

This application is intended as a testbed for features and experiments. Feel
free to fork, copy, paste, use and do whatever you like with it
(read the LICENCE file for a legal notice).

This codebase also aims to be a source of examples for a forthcoming
serie of articles about building websites (and social networks specifically)
using Rails, so, well known plugins will live beside home-made solutions.

== Interesting bits now

* i18n aware form builder at /config/initializers/sample_form_builder.rb
* model specs using Shoulda matchers at /spec/models
* controller and view tests done using Cucumber at /features
