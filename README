== Welcome to the Sample Social Network

This application is intended as a testbed for features and also as a showcase
for my Ruby and Rails experience and code. Feel free to fork, copy, paste, use
and to whatever you like with this code (read the LICENCE file for a legal notice).

This codebase aims to be a source of examples for a forthcoming series of articles
about building websites (and social networks specifically) using Rails.
