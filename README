== Welcome to the Sample Social Network

This application is intended as a testbed for features and also as a showcase
for my Ruby and Rails experience and code. Feel free to fork, copy, paste, use
and to whatever you like with this code (read the LICENCE file for a legal notice).

This codebase also aims to be a source of examples for a forthcoming
serie of articles about building websites (and social networks specifically)
using Rails, so, well known plugins will live beside home-made solutions.

== Interesting bits now

* i18n aware form builder at /config/initializers/sample_form_builder.rb
* model specs using Shoulda matchers at /spec/models
* controller and view tests done using Cucumber at /features
